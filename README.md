# py-project-collection
This is a collection of basic python projects I am building to learn and have fun with.
## Contribute
If you are also a beginner, and would like to contribute for practice, or for fun, it is more than welcome! Fork my repository and create new branches. Add additional functionality or make changes and create pull requests. I will be happy to work with anyone who is also learning Python or Github!
