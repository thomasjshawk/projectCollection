# py-project-collection
This is a collection of basic python projects I am building to learn and have fun with.
## Contribute
If you are also a beginner, and would like to contribute for practice or for fun it is more then welcome! Fork my repository, add new features or modify existing ones to add additional functionality and create pull requests. I will be happy to work with anyone who is also learning Python or Github!
